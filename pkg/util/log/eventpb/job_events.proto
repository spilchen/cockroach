// Category: Job events
// Channel: OPS
//
// Events in this category pertain to long-running jobs that are orchestrated by
// a node's job registry. These system processes can create and/or modify stored
// objects during the course of their execution.
//
// A job might choose to emit multiple events during its execution when
// transitioning from one "state" to another.
// Egs: IMPORT/RESTORE will emit events on job creation and successful
// completion. If the job fails, events will be emitted on job creation,
// failure, and successful revert.

// Import is recorded when an import job is created and successful completion.
// If the job fails, events will be emitted on job creation, failure, and
// successful revert.
